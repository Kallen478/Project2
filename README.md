* Your zoom meeting information will be available in slack in the General channel description.
* Make sure you maintain contact with your SSM if you have any issues with the class or have a general issue.
* The instructional team is here to help during office hours.
* On Saturdays, we will do some homework instruction walk-throughs in the morning.
* The learning assistant channel is there during off hours.

### Prep work and how to study

* You don't have to do much to prepare for class other than review the previous material in your study groups. Code discussion in a group is where concepts actually solidify and turn into a career. Stay humble, stay strong.
* Do homework individually. Do projects in groups. (Please remember this)
* Any installation issues, we will try to handle a week before you need it.
* You don't have to know what a class is about before you walk in, I'm probably going to be repeating the same material for weeks on end. That also means, you don't have to know everything. I'm going to repeat the same material for weeks in different ways.

### I have doubts

* Ask...
  * The instructor
  * The TA
  * The SSM
  * Learning Assistant channel
  * Your study group (I expect you should have at least one by day 4 of the course)
  * Your rubber ducky (it helps)
